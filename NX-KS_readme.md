Added Functionality

Focus buttons

Program that displays series of buttons on top of the screen

long press (1+s) to save current focus position

click to restore saved focus position

Can be used for studio shooting, astrophotography

(focus on infinity during day, recall the focus during the night), etc.

Focus stacking

Focus on near point - press \"Near\"

Focus on far point - press \"Far\"

Click \"Stack\" and wait for it to finish

Files are in the usual place - remember to fix exposure/awb/etc as you
normally would

**Focus pull** (EV+half-press shutter button)

Focus on subject 1

press EV+half-press shutter button

Focus on subject 2

Consecutive EV+half-press shutter button will be switching between focus
of the two subjects.

Adjusting focus is possible is possible at any time.

Refocus on Boot

When using hibernation (EV+AEL or Menu\>Hibernate) the camera records
last focus distance

If this option is enabled, camera will refocus to that focus distance on
boot

Batch recording

The main target users are NX500, who even with \"removed time-limit\"
still have restrictions for 4K and UHD. NX1 also has some problems with
recording too long. When button is pressed, the camera starts recording
and auto-starts new clips until \"Rec\" is pressed. Clips are split in
840sec batches, and will have about a second gap in the continuity.

Wake Lapse

Setup a Time-lapse with delayed start. Puts camera to sleep for used
defined time period, upon wake-up it starts by refocusing to the focus
position when Wake Lapse was started, and then starts taking images with
user specified time-gap between them, for user-specified duration.

**Thanks to Otto** for the programs that make this possible - keyscan,
gui, focus stacking, focus buttons, \... to name a few.\
